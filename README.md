### Project Description
[COLOR_LOT is a fun and functional app that uses ai to detect car colors in parking areas,resolve color disputes between friends,and even predit each car's horoscope and mood.]
### Project Demo
[Click here to view the deployed app](color-lot.vercel.app)

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Finally,an app that settles life's most heated debates-like whether that car is teal or blue-while also revealing if your car is secretly a moody Sagittarius that just wants a nap.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Armed with ai,questionable life choices,and way too much free time,color_lot scans your parking lot through a photo,counts car colors,assigns them ridiculous horoscopes,guesses their mood,and delivers verdicts with enough sass to end(or start)a friendship.]
