## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent clarity and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E1F5FE), a very desaturated variant of the primary, for a clean interface.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFDA63), to create a fun and engaging feeling. A much brighter and less saturated variation of the analogous hue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern, machined, objective look.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for color detection, dispute resolution, and parking slot analysis.
- Include simple animations like confetti for correct guesses in 'Dispute Buster', and smooth transitions for updating parking slot status.
- Maintain a beginner-friendly layout for both mobile and web platforms, with clear sections and easy navigation.
